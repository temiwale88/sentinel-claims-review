            "Fraud: Fraud hinges on intent: healthcare workers knowingly working outside of accepted standards for their own financial gain. Some common fraud examples include billing for services not rendered, misrepresenting dates of service, diagnosing unnecessary or incorrect treatment, or misrepresenting the identity of the patient. While these aren’t limited to dentistry, spotting nefarious intent within inappropriate claims must be done right away before unwarranted payment escalates.\n",
            "Abuse: Abuse typically involves acts that are inconsistent with identified acceptable and legitimate practices. This can result in additional and unnecessary costs to the payer, as well as possible injury to patients, who may suffer from a lack of needed care, incorrect care, or deficient care as a result. Over-coding procedures falls under the category of abuse. Examples of over-coding include billing for a higher extraction code when the lower code is more in line with the actual process per extraction codes contained in CDT. The higher code is generally reimbursed at a higher rate, thus using more of the patient's available dental plan benefit.\n",
            "Waste: A major problem for dental payers that often goes unchecked is waste, or billing for medically unnecessary services. Waste in dental services not only affects the dental plans, but it inaccurately deducts from their members’ yearly maximum benefit, potentially leaving insufficient funds for other necessary procedures.\n",
